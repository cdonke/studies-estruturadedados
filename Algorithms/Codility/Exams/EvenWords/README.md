# Exercise


In an _even_ word, each letter occurs an even number of times.
Write a function that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the minimum number of letters that must
be deleted to obtain an even word.

Examples:
1) Given `S="acbcbba"`, the function should return 1 (one letter b must be deleted)
1) Given `S="axxaxa"`, your function shlhoud return 2 (one letter a and one letter x must be deleted)
1) Give `S="aaaa"`, your function should return 0 (there is no neeed to delete any letters).

Write an *efficient* algorithim for the following assumptions:
- N is an integer within the rage [0..200_000]
- string S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z)
